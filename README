more than logic
A collection of C++ libraries for openFrameworks (http://www.openframeworks.cc)

To install, clone this repo at the root of your openFrameworks 0062 directory.
Examples available at https://github.com/morethanlogic/mtlExamples.

mtlBox2d
--------------------------------
A Box2d (http://www.box2d.org) wrapper. Uses Box2d version 2.1.2. 
Heavily based on Todd Vanderlin's ofxBox2d wrapper (http://code.google.com/p/vanderlin/)

mtlBusyIndicator
--------------------------------
A bridge/delegate/controller/whateveryouwanttocallit for the iPhone UIActivityIndicatorView. 
ofxiPhone only!

mtlSceneManager
--------------------------------
A C++ framework for managing scenes (aka views) in openFrameworks applications for the iPhone. Very useful for creating applications with many states (menus, option screens, games, ...) and transitioning between them.
Requires prisonerjohn's fork of the ofxTween addon (https://github.com/prisonerjohn/ofxTween).
ofxiPhone only! (although porting it to desktop oF should be pretty straightforward)

mtlSignedPixels
--------------------------------
A simple class for performing signed operations on pixels. Useful if your calculations on pixels sometimes go in the negative realm...

mtlTraerPhysics
--------------------------------
An openFrameworks port of Jeffrey Traer Bernstein's physics library for Processing (http://traer.cc/mainsite/physics/). No collisions but super fast and easy to use.

Enjoy!
